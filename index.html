    <h3>About Apple A Day</h3>
    <p>
        Apple A Day was created to help individuals keep up and stay in touch with their loved ones’, while having the ability to check up on their mental health.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our goal is for people to use our app or website so that they are aware of their loved ones' mental health and have a place where they can share how they feel.
    </p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
        I want to find an app that allows me to stay in touch with family and friends by checking their status with a single button. 
        Often, it's hard to keep up with everyone through text and calls, so something simple that can remind me to check in with them would be nice.
        Something that can help me work through my mental health while still helping me keep up with my responsibilities would be the best option.
    </p>

    <p>
        My partner sometimes struggles with overworking themselves during peak busy work/school season. 
        I would like to have an app that allows me to send a quick check-up notification, just so they know that I am thinking about them.
        The notification should not be intrusive, but should just be a quick reminder that they should take breaks.
    </p>

    <p>
        I have a family member that just moved to China. 
        I have been trying to keep up with them through texts and calls but our busy schedules, not to mention the time difference, makes it hard. 
        Through our limited conversations I feel as though they have been struggling with their mental health due to the new environment and the lack of friends so I have been looking for an app to stay in touch with them by checking their status with a single button.
    </p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>

    </ul>
    
    <h3>Potential Obstacles</h3>

        <li>Users may feel overwhelmed by too many features.</li>
        <li>The app must remain simple and easy to interact with.</li>
    </ul>
