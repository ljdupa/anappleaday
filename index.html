    <h1>Apple A Day</h1>
    <h2>Group Name: Apple A Day</h2>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
        I want to find an app that allows me to stay in touch with family and friends by checking their status with a single button. 
        Often, it's hard to keep up with everyone through text and calls, so something simple that can remind me to check in with them would be nice.
        Something that can help me work through my mental health while still helping me keep up with my responsibilities would be the best option.
    </p>

    <p>
        My family member has been struggling recently with their mental health, and due to timezone differences, we aren't always able to have in depth conversations about how they're doing. 
        It would be nice to have an app that allows for quick check-ups while keeping a more simple interface. 
    </p>

    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blend mental health checkups with daily responsibilities.</li>
        <li>An app that works on both desktop and mobile without either platform lacking features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Actions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add events and tasks to a calendar with unlimited color sorting for subjects.</li>
        <li>A simple button that can be clicked to send mental health reassurances and reminders (drink water, go on a walk, take a break, brush teeth, take a shower).</li>
        <li>Trackers for daily feelings with the option to add or remove trackers as desired.</li>
        <li>Trackers may include: daily mood, water intake, and workout duration.</li>
    </ul>
